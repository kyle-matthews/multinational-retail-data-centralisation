### 1. Introduction
By trade I am currently a Primary School Teacher in the UK, but I am massively keen on reskilling and retraining to become a cloud/data engineer of some sort. The task is rather daunting with two young kittens and an extortionate mortgage to pay off, but here we are. I will begin with the words that I often use to sell outrageous or unbelievable ideas to my class with, 'lets say...'

*Lets say,* that I am employed by a multinational corporation that sells various goods across the globe. You want it, they've got it. Much like PepsiCo or Nestle, they have their fingers in a lot of pies.

Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources making it not easily accessible or analysable by current members of the team.

In an effort to become more data-driven, the organisation would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.

My first aime is to produce a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.

I will then query the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

### 2. Installation Instructions

This program will run straight from your command line so the directory containing all of the files needs to be saved somewhere where you can find it. 

**(Warning: If you remove/move any Python files, it will most likely result in the program no longer working.)**

---

### 3. Usage Instructions

The program runs directly from the command line. 
- cd into the directory that the folder is saved into and open `main.py`.
- From there everything should be handled automatically. 
- The data will be taken from the remote AWS RDS server and added directly to your own SQL server.
